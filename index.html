        <p class="lead mb-4">I am nineteen years old. I am currently attending the University of California, Riverside. Before the University of California, Riverside I attended Jurupa Hills High School. I took IB classes my junior and senior year of high school. The IB classes that I took during my junior and senior year included math, english, history and spanish. I played on the school soccer team  during my four years of high school. My freshmen, sophomore, and Junior year I was on the Junior Varsity team. I played on the varsity team my senior year of high school. I won a couple of tournaments during those four years which include winning league my sophomore year, winning a tournament my junior year, and reaching the first round of CIF my senior year. I was still able to achieve high grades during high school despite using up most of my time playing soccer.<br><br>

        After graduating from high school I worked with my dad during the summer. My dad works at a Bridgestone Firestone Warehouse. My job was to help out in the UPS section or to help load up trucks with tires. In the UPS section we would place labels on the tires. Then, we would use a machine to band tires together and roll them into the trailer. We would take turns going into the container and stack the tires to make more space. The heat inside the container was unbearable, we would come out sweating a lot. Besides working at UPS I also helped to load up trailers. I would grab the tires from the pallets and roll them to the guy that is inside the container. Then, the guys sets up the tires in a certain pattern so that they would all fit. I did this for all of summer break. I stopped working at the Bridgestone Warehouse when college started so that I could focus more on school. <br><br>

        Currently I am working at the Rialto Home Depot. I have been working there for the past five months. I started out working in the parking lot position. In the parking lot I would take the carts in front of the store and sanitize them so that the customers can use them. I would also help customers load up their cars or trucks when ever they needed help. After two months I got promoted to order puller. As an order puller I have a phone that receives the online orders that people make and then I pick them from the store and take them to the service desk or to the back in receiving. I also, help customers load if they need help loading up their orders or deliveries. I am currently still working at the Rialto Home Depot. I am a full-time student at the University of California Riverside and am working thirty to thirty five hours a week at Home Depot.
